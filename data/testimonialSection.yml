  - name: Avi D.
    comment: Ryan has a rare combination of quantitative skills and high EQ. He lead the marketing and digital strategy for the Syria Solar project with UOSSM and was tactfully able to suggest the highest yielding options for marketing the project. He is able to simplify incredibly complex quantitative measures into digestible ideas. I have observed him to be a truly gifted communicator and a powerful leader.
